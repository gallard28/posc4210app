              Your consulting team has recently taken over a policy analysis project from a federal agency. The agency team was trained well and used the Policy Problem Sovling approach to identify a problem, disaggregate the problem, and make hypotheses. However, they did not have a chance to prioritize hypotheses, select analytical tools and techniques, conduct the analyses, or synthesize the results.
