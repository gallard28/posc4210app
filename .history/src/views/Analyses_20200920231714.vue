            I have reviewed your workplan and have made a few revisisons. First, I knocked out a few hypotheses from consideration for analysis based on prior knowledge from other analyses and research we have done about these topics utility for decreasing spread or decreasing severity. Second, below I present four workplans from which you may only choose 1. Based on your choice of workplan, my analysts will conduct the analyses and provide you with results. It will then be up to you to synthesize what the results mean.
