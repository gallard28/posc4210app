        <p class="flow-text">We will be simulating what happens once you have a logic tree and hypotheses, but need to prioritize them, test them, and interpret the results. You will only be responsible for very basic testing (I have done most of the work for you); however, you will be asked to draw conclusions by synthesizing the results. We will also be simulating making these decisions under the pressure of scarce resources--time and money. Below, I have outlined the flow of this assignment from start to finish.</p>
