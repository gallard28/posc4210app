            <h3>Scenario</h3>
            <p class="left-align">
              Your consulting team has recently taken over a policy analysis project from a federal agency. The agency team was trained well and used the Policy Problem Sovling approach to identify a problem, disaggregate the problem, and make hypotheses. However, they did not have a chance to prioritize hypotheses, select analytical tools and techniques, conduct the analyses, or synthesize the results. 
            </p> <br><br>
            <h3>Your Task</h3>
            <p class="left-align">
              Your task is to prioritize hypotheses, choose analytical tools, conduct the analyses, and synthesize the results. This web application will guide you through the journey although you will need to record it on your <a href="">Google Docs PAE Workbook</a>. 
            </p><br><br>
            <h3>The Rules</h3>
            <p class="left-align">
              Please follow directions carefully. You can <b>ONLY</b> use the resources and analyses presented in the web app. If you run out of resource units without gaining a clear picture, then you must do your best to tell your customer the story and to ask for more resources.
